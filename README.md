# Protomithium

Protomithium is a platformer that I made to test out LibGDX.

Some features implemented:
- Simple animations with a controller using state machines
- Simple behaviour trees for the enemy
- Pathfinding using a modified A* to include jumps
- A very basic GUI showing score and health (Player does not die when health reaches 0 for testing purposes, health bar is just for show)
- Can kill enimies by jumping on the enemy head only, side collisions only hurt the player
